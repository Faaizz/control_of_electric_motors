## Methods of Soft Control

### Goals
Implement the following on suitable systems:
- Fuzzy control
    - Full fuzzy
    - Hybrid (fuzzy + conventional)
    - Fuzzy adapptation of controller parameters
    - Fuzzy switching between multiple controllers
- Neural networks (NN)
    - Fully connected NN
    - Radial Basis Function NN
    - Self organizing maps (SOM)
    - Support vector machines (SVM)
- Evolutionary algorithms
    - Genetic algorithm to find the best hyperparameters for one of the  NNs above
