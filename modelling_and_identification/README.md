## Modelling and Identification

### Goals

- Generate identification data for multiple system models
    - Model a PRBS signal generator in Simulink 

- Implement the following system identification approaches:
    - Least squares 
    - Least squares (recursive)
    - Least squares (with forgetting factor)
    - Prediction error methods
    - Instrumental variable mathods
    - Subspace identification

- Try out Fuzzy T-S dynamic system modelling approach
